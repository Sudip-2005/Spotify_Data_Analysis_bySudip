📘 Project Title

Exploring Trends and Insights in Spotify Music Dataset

🧩 Problem Statement

The music industry today is heavily data-driven, with platforms like Spotify collecting vast amounts of data about songs, artists, and user preferences.
The goal of this project is to analyze Spotify’s track-level data to uncover patterns and relationships between different audio features (like energy, danceability, tempo, etc.) and a song’s popularity.
This helps understand what makes a song popular, and how various attributes contribute to its success.

🔍 Key Findings

Energy and Danceability are major contributors to a track’s popularity.

Loudness and Tempo show moderate correlation with popularity — upbeat songs often trend higher.

Valence (positivity) tends to differ by genre — happier tones generally appeal more.

Radar charts comparing most and least popular songs highlight clear contrasts in rhythm and mood.

Temporal analysis (if included) suggests trends in audio features evolving across years.
